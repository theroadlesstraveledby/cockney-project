    <p>If you've never gotten familiar with Cockney rhyming slang, this site will give you a few examples to some of the more known phrases. <br/> <br/>
    So how does it work? In most cases, each word has a matching rhyme that consists of two words. When used as part of a conversation - the last word of th rhyme is omitted (sometimes the first word is dropped instead).<br/><br/>
    So, for instance, if you'd like to tell someone to go down the stairs, you might use the phrase "Go down the apples and pears" or simply "Go down the apples".<br/><br/> Cockney rhyming slang emerged not so long ago, around the 1840s in the East End area in London, and slowly spread throughout the city and many other parts of the UK. It remains quite popular to this day.</p>
